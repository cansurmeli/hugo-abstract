# README

Hugo Abstract is not a finished theme but rather a starting point for theme development. While having a foundation with [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)([SASS version](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass)) it provides the bare minimum for you to develop your brand new responsive Hugo theme.

## Objectives

- Be as minimal as it can be,
- Minimise JS dependencies,
- Prefer YAML over TOML:
	- personal reason,
	- I like the syntax better,
- Use Hugo best practices.

## Why Skeleton?

At the time of this writing, Skeleton had close to 20K stars on GitHub. You can naturally ask why I have not used a much more popular framework such as Bootstrap. I worked a lot with Bootstrap and it is good but for this project I wanted the barebones and extreme minimalism.

Plus, the above makes Skeleton dead easy to understand.

## Why SASS?

It could be obvious to the most but [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) makes a CSS project much easier to manage. You can learn more about it on their website or on the web.
